This paper implements the code for Gate Level Information flow tracking (GLIFT) as described in the paper  https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~weh140/resource/TCAD_11.pdf

## Project Description
This project is about code implementation of Gate level information flow tracking (GLIFT), a Hardware based information flow Technique by Cpp language.
   
## Introduction
Information flow tracking is an effective tool in computer security for detecting unintended information flows.software based information flow tracking 
implementations have drawbacks in preciseness and performance . So we go to hardware based information flow tracking, GLIFT (Gate level information flow tracking).GLIFT tracks information flow at the granularity of indivisual bits.
This project is to do fundamental analysis of GLIFT and its properties and to implement the theories via code and verify the same using test cases.

## How to execute
