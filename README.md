## Introduction
As Information flow tracking is an effective tool in computer security for detecting unintended information flows.software based information flow tracking 
implementations have drawbacks in preciseness and performance . So we go to hardware based such as GLIFT (Gate level information flow tracking).GLIFT tracks
information flow at the granularity of indivisual bits.
